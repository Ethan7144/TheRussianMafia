Hello there! My userID on github is @TheRussianMafia, but my name is Ethan.
This github is mostly here to demonstrate coding projects that I have personally done in my own free time, and also as projects that have been completed 
during my time at college.
Anything on here, will be explicitly stated on who worked on it with me and I will give credit to anybody who helped me with a project at anytime.
